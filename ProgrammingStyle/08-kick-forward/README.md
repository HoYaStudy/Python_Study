# Style #8

Variation of the pipeline style, with the following additional constraints:

* Each function takes an additional parameter, usually the last, which is another function
* That function parameter is applied at the end of the current function
* That function parameter is given as input what would be the output of the current function
* Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions, but where the next function to be applied is given as parameter to the current function

## Possible names:

* Kick your teammate forward!
* Continuation-passing style
* Crochet loop
