# Style #31

Very similar to style #30, but with an additional twist

## Constraints:

* Input data is divided in chunks, similar to what an inverse multiplexer does to input signals
* A map function applies a given worker function to each chunk of data, potentially in parallel
* The results of the many worker functions are reshuffled in a way that allows for the reduce step to be also parallelized
* The reshuffled chunks of data are given as input to a second map function that takes a reducible function as input

## Possible names:

* Map-reduce
* Hadoop style
* Double inverse multiplexer
