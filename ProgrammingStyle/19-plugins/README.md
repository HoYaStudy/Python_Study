# Style #19

## Constraints:

* The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.)
* All or some of those abstractions are physically encapsulated into their own, usually pre-compiled, packages. Main program and each of the packages are compiled independently. These packages are loaded dynamically by the main program, usually in the beginning (but not necessarily).
* Main program uses functions/objects from the dynamically-loaded packages, without knowing which exact implementations will be used. New implementations can be used without having to adapt or recompile the main program.
* External specification of which packages to load. This can be done by a configuration file, path conventions, user input or other mechanisms for external specification of code to be linked at run time.

## Possible names:

* No commitment
* Plugins
* Dependency injection
