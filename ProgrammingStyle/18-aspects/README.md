# Style #18

## Constraints:

* The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.)
* Aspects of the problem are added to the main program without any edits to the source code of the abstractions. These side functions latch on the main abstractions by naming them, as in "I'm an aspect of foo (even though foo may not know it!)"

## Possible names:

* Asides
* Aspect-oriented style
* Rewriting the story
