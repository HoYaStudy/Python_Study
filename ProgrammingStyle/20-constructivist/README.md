# Style #20

## Constraints:

* Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its arguments and either returns something sensible when the arguments are unreasonable or assigns them reasonable values
* All code blocks check for possible errors and escape the block when things go wrong, setting the state to something reasonable

## Possible names:

* Constructive
* Defensive
* Hopeful
* Shit happens, life goes on
