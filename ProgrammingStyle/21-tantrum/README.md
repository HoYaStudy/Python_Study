# Style #21

## Constraints:

* Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its arguments and refuses to continue when the arguments are unreasonable
* All code blocks check for all possible errors, possibly print out context-specific messages when errors occur, and pass the errors up the function call chain

## Possible names:

* Tantrum
* Design by contract
* Mental breakdown
