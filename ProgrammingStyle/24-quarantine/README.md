# Style #24

This style is a variation of style #09, The One, with the following additional constraints:

## Constraints:

* Core program functions have no side effects of any kind, including IO
* All IO actions must be contained in computation sequences that are clearly separated from the pure functions
* All sequences that have IO must be called from the main program

## Possible names:

* Quarantine
* Monadic IO
* Imperative functional style
