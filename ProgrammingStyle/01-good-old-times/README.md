# Style #1

## Constraints:

* Very small amount of primary memory, typically orders of magnitude smaller than the data that needs to be processed/generated. (The example sets the limit to 1024 cells)
* No labels -- i.e. no variable names or tagged memory addresses. All we have is memory that is addressable with numbers.

## Possible names:

* Good old times
* Early 50s style
