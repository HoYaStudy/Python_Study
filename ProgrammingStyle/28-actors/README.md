# Style #28

Similar to the letterbox style, but where the 'things' have independent threads of execution.

## Constraints:

* The larger problem is decomposed into 'things' that make sense for the problem domain
* Each 'thing' has a queue meant for other \textit{things} to place messages in it
* Each 'thing' is a capsule of data that exposes only its ability to receive messages via the queue
* Each 'thing' has its own thread of execution independent of the others.

## Possible names:

* Free agents
* Active letterbox
* Actors
