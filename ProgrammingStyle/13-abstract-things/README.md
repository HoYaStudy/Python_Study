# Style #13

## Constraints:

* The larger problem is decomposed into 'abstract things' that make sense for the problem domain
* Each abstract thing is described by what operations the things of that abstraction can eventually do
* Concrete things are then bound, somehow, to the abstractions; mechanisms for doing that vary
* The rest of the application uses the things not by what they are but by they do in abstract

## Possible names:

* Abstract things
* Abstract data types
