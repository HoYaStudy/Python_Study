# Style #30

## Constraints:

* Input data is divided in chunks, similar to what an inverse multiplexer does to input signals
* A map function applies a given worker function to each chunk of data, potentially in parallel
* A reduce function takes the results of the many worker functions and recombines them into a coherent output

## Possible names:

* Map-reduce
* Inverse multiplexer (check out electronics)
